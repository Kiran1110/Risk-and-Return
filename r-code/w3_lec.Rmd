## 3.3 What is Risk?

### Fundamental Sources of Risk

**1. Economy-wide / Macro / Systematic**

Examples:

- big oil shock
- interest rate changes
- government policies

**2. Specific / Idiosyncratic / Unique**

- technological change specific to your product
- management's investment decisions



## 3.8 Recap Module 3

Portfolio diversification removes specific/unique risks of individual securities. Thus, the average (risk) standard deviation of a portfolio is always higher than the standard deviation of the collective market (securities/stocks).

To value a new company, examine:

- its cashflow
- the cost of capital (assets) (market interest rate) of a comparable firm: $r_a$

Cashflow is known; a signature of the company. However, we don't know the cost of capital, which is what we want to determine. Now, **real assets** don't trade, but **equity** and **debt** (collectively known as liabilities) are publically traded.

To simplify the problem, assume debt is zero (firm has no debt). Then, the risk and return of the equity is **identical** to the risk and return of real assets. The reason is that the balance sheet balances: the value of assets is completely financed by the equity.
